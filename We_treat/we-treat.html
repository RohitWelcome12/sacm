                                    <p class="mb-0">Coronary Artery Disease is the most common type of heart disease which is one among the leading causes of death worldwide. It is caused by reduced blood flow to heart muscles due to build-up of plaque (Atherosclerosis) in the arteries of heart. In India, studies have shown increasing prevalence of CAD over the last 60 years, from 1% to 9%-10% in urban populations and &lt;1% to 4%-6% in rural populations. Incidence of mortality (death) is also increasing. Important risk factors for CAD in India as reported by Case-control studies include:&nbsp;Dyslipidemia (high “bad” cholesterol), smoking, Diabetes, Hypertension, abdominal Obesity, psycho-social Stress, unhealthy Diet, and physical inactivity1. Over time, CAD can also weaken the heart muscle and lead to heart failure and arrhythmias.<br><br>Primary predisposing cause of Coronary Artery Disease is the Atherosclerosis. It refers to narrowing of arteries on the inside due to thickening and hardening because of plaque deposition. Thickening happens due to gradual deposition of fat, cholesterol or other substances in the wall of an artery. Hardening of the arterial wall is a progressive condition that may begin in childhood and progress with age. Based on severity and location, Atherosclerosis can also cause Stroke, Kidney problems, peripheral artery disease etc. “Arterial Remodeling” refers to a change in vessel size. In normal arteries, remodeling is a homeostatic response to changes in the flow and circumferential stretch to restore normal shear stress and wall tension, respectively. However, repeated injury can hamper this mechanism.<br><br>When the Heart fails to get enough blood supply for itself, it is called Ischemia. When the part of heart affected gets very less blood supply or is completely cut off, the muscle gets damaged or dies. This is called Myocardial Infarction (MI). This damage is expressed through chest pain (Angina) which is the predominant sign of CAD. Pain may range from being slight discomfort to being unbearable to an extent where the patient collapses; it may be localized resembling heartburn or radiate to shoulders, neck, jaw especially on the left.<br><br>Understanding Atherosclerosis in Ayurveda<br><br>Plaque formation begins as a compensatory mechanism after the arteries get injured repeatedly. ‘Why’ (cause) and ‘Where’ it occurs is important as it influences treatment which is the only need of the patient. ‘How’ it occurs is important for the physician to base target specific medicines.<br><br>Repeated internal injury can be correlated to involvement of Vrana in Mamsa and Sira. Sira broadly refers to entire channels carrying body fluids and therefore can be Arteries, Veins or Lymphatic vessels. Mamsa (muscle tissue) can depict the musculature of vessels. When a Mamsagata vrana gets irritated / or inflamed, the exudates is similar to Ghee in colour and consistency. This can be compared with Fatty streaks and later chronic dyslipidemia –Atherosclerosis. When a Sira is cut / tore open; excess bleeding, leaking of plasma etc is described. This can depict the stages of endothelial injury which acts initial trigger &amp; is caused by chronic dyslipedaemia and raised blood pressure. High BP can be caused secondarily due to Margavarana (reduced luminal space in vessels). In long standing Vrana, this mechanism is similar to pathological changes in complicated plaques such as Ulceration, thrombosis, haemorrhage etc. In cases of chronic Hypertension, the pressure itself may be responsible for repeated injuries in arterial wall (Mamsa dushti) or even rupture (Sira vrana). The atheromatous plaque is comparable to deposition of dushita Kapha and Rakta.<br><br>Understanding Angina and MI in Ayurveda<br><br>The pain in the cardiac region is mentioned via various terms depending on the type of pain, extent of discomfort etc in Ayurveda. Hrut (heart) – Shoola (pain accompanied by difficulty in breathing), Veshtana (squeezing / forcible contraction causing pain), Vyatha (distress, fear), Toda (pricking pain), Peeda (irritation, pain), Ayama (forcible expansion causing pain), Dravata / Spandana (palpitations), Bheda (splitting/cracking like pain), Patati Iva (feeling of heart slipping from its place / sudden thrill) 1 etc are few examples. Therefore, chest pain may refer to any of these pains, which is an important indicator of underlying dosha &amp; samprapti (pathophysiology). Vata is responsible for all kinds of Pain. It may be alone or in association with other Doshas, localized or radiating which gives rise to different types. Consecutively, the treatment module will alter.<br><br>The involvement of myocardium in ischemia &amp; infarct suggests the involvement of Rasa dhatu, Rakta dhatu, Mamsa dhatu (and their respective srotas), sira &amp; dhamani.<br><br>Angina is described as a symptom in many diseases in Ayurveda including Vataja – jwara (~a type of Fever), Kasa (~Cough), Chardi (~Vomiting), Moorcha (~Fainting/ syncope), Shwasa (~Respiratory disorders), Pandu (~Anaemia), Kshaya (~A disease causing depletion of the body), Gulma (~Diverticular disease?), Udara (except jalodara) (generalized distension or enlargement of abdomen of any aetiology), Udavarta (diseases due to reverse movement of Vata), Madatyaya (~Alcoholism), Apatantraka (~Epileptic disorder), Sharkara &amp; Ashmari (~Renal calculi) etc. It is also seen as premonitory symptom in Atisara (~Diarrhoea). In Pittaja prameha (~Diabetes Mellitus) and Vidradhi (~Abscess), chest pain is said to be upadrava (complication). Local internal findings such as Hrudi Vidradhi (wound/abscess in the heart) can also cause angina.<br><br>Management of CAD<br><br>Based on the Bala (strength) of Roga (disease) and Rogi (patient) i.e., stage/severity of the disease and strength of the person, Mrudu (mild) or Nitya (daily) Shodhana (cleansing) may be advised. For instant pain reduction, immediate regulation of Vata is of prime importance. To stop disease progress while maintaining the strength, oral medications such as Shoola prashamana gana dravyas, Jeevaniya ghruta, Yavani shadava, Taleesadi churna, Bruhat Vata Chintami rasa, Dhanvantaram gulika, Dashamoolarishta, Prabhakara vati; in Pittanubandha Vata, Drakshadi kashayam, Sutashekara rasa, Nagarjunabhra rasa, Pravala panchamrita rasa etc; in Kaphanubandha Vata, Hrudayarnava rasa, Trivrutadi churna, Dashamoola kashaya with saindhava, Gandharva hareetaki tablet etc may be used. Since the disease is a Marma-ashrita vyadhi with involvement of Madhyama Roga Marga i.e., involves vital organs &amp; systems, treatment requires time and patience. Use of Basti (medicated Enema therapy) may be done to reinstate innate strength. Rasayana therapy to reinvigorate the body must be done.<br><br>In brief, the path of disease occurrence (samprapti) can be multiple based on the causative factors such as lifestyle &amp; risk factors associated. The Ayurvedic analysis of any case presenting with Angina, with or without prior diagnosis of CAD / IHD is therefore based on thorough history taking followed by mapping the probable samprapti &amp; then a suitable treatment plan based on Nadee &amp; other 7 Pareekshas. Acute management will involve re-establishing the normal route &amp; intensity of Vata while balancing the other two doshas if need be.<br><br>Ayurvedic perspective of Coronary Artery Disease :<br><br>Signs and symptoms explained under IHD (Coronary Artery Disease) resemble lakshanas (symptoms) of handful of diseases in Ayurveda, especially – Dhatugata Vata (deep seated vitiated Vata Dosha) and Udavarta (Vata which has lost it’s normal path). The samprapti (pathogenesis) predominantly depicts kha vaigunya (defect in the channels of the body) due to sroto dushti (defective channel) (sanga, granthi). The causative factors (hurry, worry, spicy curry lifestyle) lead to Ama formation, which refers to the undigested or improperly digested food that remains (adheres) in the body without excretion. When such deposition increases, the homeostasis is hampered. This gives rise to obstruction of channels, loss of strength and appetite, breathlessness, changes in bowel movement (slimy stools, incomplete evacuation), easy fatigue etc. Atherosclerosis resembles Ama in its tendency of coating the srotas (channels of the body). This in turn disturbs the normal movements of Vata, with greater emphasis on Vyana and Udana gati (Vyaan and Udana are the types of Vata). At the level of Dhatu (building blocks of our body or vaguely, tissues), Vata which disturbs mamsa and medas is said to cause ‘danda mushti hatamiva atyarta toda (severe pain as if beaten by a rod or fist), shrama (fatigue) and ruja (body-ache)’ (Charaka Chikitsa 28/ 32).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Another reason for indirect impact of dushta Vata ( vitiated Vata ) on Hridaya is Vegadharana, especially those which impact Apana and Udana Vata ( tpes of Vata). Vegadharana refers to controlling natural urges like thirst, hunger, defecation, urination, flatus, tears, breathing etc. This leads to a condition called Udavarta where the Doshas (led by Vata), change their physiological path of movement. The symptoms like Hrudayoparodha (blockage to normal functioning of heart), Hrudaya kampa (palpitations), Hrudi vyatha (chest pain), Hridroga (cardiac issues) etc are caused due to forceful controlling of Apana Vata (responsible for defecation, flatus, menstruation etc), Udgara (belching), Trishna (thirst) and Ashru (tears), Shrama nishwasa (breathing after exertion) respectively. (Charaka Sutra 7, Sushruta Uttara 55).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stability and instability of occurrence of chest pain may be correlated to the extent of Ama, Rasa vikruti, Vyana-Udana-Prana dushti (including anyonyavarana) and involvement of Sadhaka Pitta ( a type of Pitta). When the history and development of samprapti is chronic, dhatu shaithilya (~ flaccidity of tissues) may also be considered. Sthanika kha vaigunya can also occur directly in manovikara ( Psychological problems), as seen in involvement of Hridaya in Unmada, Apasmara ( these are the types of Psycological disorders)&nbsp;samprapti and lakshana.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to chikitsa, nidana parivarjana (to avoid the causes) and adopting pathya ( healthy diet) is mandatory. Without this crucial step, no treatment can commence. The principle here is protecting Hridaya marma (~ heart) by re-establishing Vata gati ( direction of Vata Dosha) whilst ensuring ama pachana ( digestion of undigested material) and maintaining dhatu bala (integrity). In case of Bahudosha (adherent toxins / unwanted unsaturated fatty acids) – Panchakarma can be done with proper care and caution. Snehapana ( intake of ghee / oil or any form of lipids) and swedana ( sudation) offers targeted removal of adherent ama without harming the delicate circulatory structures. This ama will then be expelled. The next step would be to ensure agni deepana ( kindling of digestive fire) (especially dhatvagni) and hridya medicines and food. Rasayana (rejuvenating drugs)&nbsp;may be selected based on nidana (cause)&nbsp;and extent of vyadhi (disease).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like any other disease, IHD can be managed efficiently using Ayurveda. Prompt ashtasthana pareeksha (8 modes of examination as explained in ayurveda), customized pathya (diet) and suitable oushadha ( medicine) can help the patient in leading a better, independent life.</p>

Therefore Cardiovascular diseases may not always fall under Hrudroga. They may develop as consequences of underlying anomalies such as Udavarta, Dhatugata Vata, Pandu etc. Hence the treatment will be to curb the causative pathology while subsequently maintaining the cardiac health.<br><br>Ayurvedic perspective of Cardiomyopathy :<br><br>The site affected as a rule in Cardiomyopathy is the muscular tissue. This may be generally considered as a dhatugata vikara (problem deep rooted in the body tissues). Since in most cases the muscle becomes stiff and enlarged, it may be attributed to dushta, leenavata (vitiated Vata which has adhered / mixed with deeper tissues of the body).<br><br>Signs and symptoms of vataja hridroga (heart disease due to the vitiation of Vata Dosha), vataja shotha (swelling / edema – caused due to the vitiation of Vata), mamsagata vata (Vata lodged in muscle tissue?) and other vata prdhana (predominantly Vata Dosha) (pittanubandha (associated with Pitta Dosha), in many cases) etc can be compared to various cardiomyopathies. The presence of Pitta is necessary (along with Vata) for the focused dhatukshaya / vikruti (depletion or disturbed body tissues) at deeper levels.<br><br>The samprapti (pathogenesis) depicts mamasavaha srotodushti (problem in the channel of muscle tissue?) with underlying rasavaha srotodushti (vitiation of channel of plasma tissue?).&nbsp;Involvement of dushta Vata and Pitta is essential, mostly with kapha kshaya (depletion of Kapha dosha). Initially, this causes complaints of fluctuations in BP, Fatigue, Breathlessness etc. Once Hridaya becomes sthana (site) of dushta dosha (vitiated dosha), local alterations in structure begin. Alternatively, vatadushti due to Kapha / aama (indigestion) vriddhi (increase) sanga (obstruction) to normal vata gati (direction of Vata), causing vimargagamana (abnormal direction of Vata)) can also lead to kha vaigunya (Vitiation of channel ? ) in Hridaya, and ultimately, Hridroga. The condition can exacerbate due to manovikara (disorders of mind). History of shwasa (Asthma or any kind of breathing disorders), kasa (cough), gulma (A boll kind of formation of Vata in abdominal cavity?), arsha (piles), udavarta (upward / abnormal movement of Vata); smoking, chewing tobacco etc is seen clinically in many cases of this disease.<br><br>As stated previously, different presentations of cardio-myopathy (hypertrophic, stress, dilated etc) depict various disorders in Ayurveda including Vatavyadhi (disorders of Vata), dhatugata leenadosha, Shwasa, vataja gulma etc. This condition can be effectively managed and prevented through practises such as Nitya Abhyanga (regular oil application to the body), Pranayama, seasonal shodhana (Panchakarma) etc. Medicines and treatments are mainly vatahara (which reduce Vata), pitta shamaka (which reduce Pitta) and balya&nbsp;(nourishing). Recurrent snehapana (oral intake of medicated ghee / oil) followed by mriduvirechana (mild purgation therapy), Matrabasti (administration of small amount of oil / ghruta through anal route), abhyanga and avagahasweda (tub bath) etc provide definitve (Nirnayaka) results. Formulations such as brihatvata chintamani, drakshadi kashayam, Nagarjunabhra rasa etc are beneficial. Judicious use of Rasayana dravya (medications which nourish our body tissues) such as Agastyahareetaki lehya, abhraka bhasma, swarna kalpa etc can help the patient lead an independent life.&nbsp;<br><br>Ayurveda perception of this disease is not comparable to a single vyadhi (disease) entity. Therefore, diagnosis and monitoring through ashta sthaana pareeksha (8 folds of examination explained in Ayurveda), especially Nadee pareeksha (pulse examination) can enable the practitioner to detect and treat (or manage) the condition at the earliest. Pathya (diet) along with suitable therapy (or medications) goes a long way in achieving normalcy in the life of the patient.</p>

Basic metabolic changes will result in changes in dhatu. Initially there are functional changes and if not resolved over a period of time, structural modification occurs. This leads to symptoms like shrama (fatigue), agni vikruti (reduced or fluctuating appetite), vibandha (difficulty in/ incomplete bowel movement), nidra bhramsha (disturbed sleep), irritation etc. Further, shwasa krichrata (breathlessness) on walking or climbing short distances, bhrama (dizziness), hriddrava (palpitations), moha (blackouts) etc will develop. By now, people start realising that something is wrong and go for measurements of Blood Pressure and other parameters. This explanation draws attention to the fact that BP variations do not develop overnight.&nbsp;Stress is experienced both as cause and effect of variations in Rasa and Raktha dhatu.<br><br>The samprapti is usually similar to that of pandu, raktapitta, amashayagata vata, pittanubandha viloma vata, amavata etc. Viloma gati of vata is noted in most cases. In case of Pitta involvement, the nadee remains sharp even in vata (and sometimes in kapha) sthana. The nature of beats in sphygmomanometer can also be observed similarly. Lakshana of rasa and/or rakta vikriti are noted.<br><br>Treatment principles primarily aim at correcting the commonly seen metabolic disturbances. This is called Nidana pratyanika chikitsa (stopping the cause). Along with this, Vyadhi pratyanika chikitsa (condition specific medicines or therapies) are prescribed. Stress management is done through counselling the patient to be strong, understanding oneself, meditation etc. This creates a positive self image, makes them aware in trying to understand themselves, develops acceptance etc. Guided meditation is advised. Behavioural changes remain a part and parcel of management. Medicines such as Drakshadi kashaya, Pravala panchamrita rasa, Sudarshana vati, Dhanvantara gulika; Herbs such as Jatamamsi, Ashwagandha, Manjishta etc are used.<br><br>Hypertensive heart disease<br><br>The involvement of heart rather than any other vital organ primarily is due to the fact that it is the point of origin of Rasavaha srotas (channels carrying Rasa) and Manas, the seat of emotions and intellect. Quantitatively increased yet qualitatively deficient Rasa and Raktha dhatu can cause variations in amount of nutrition and oxygenated blood reaching the tissues. This can cause sudden blackouts, local injury, change in impulse generation and spread – causing palpitations and later fibrillations, stroke, or even death. All these result due to disturbed Dosha which settle in the heart due to continued practise of aforesaid causes. This is termed “leena dosha” or dosha which are deeply seated in the dhatu. It depicts the chronic nature. Since hridaya is a sadyo- pranahara marma, such variations can often become detrimental. It can also cause Ojas kshaya.<br><br>The principle of treatment includes a major correction of lifestyle supplemented by medicines or therapies to establish normalcy. The aim of treatment is to always bring a balance between the body and mind using minimal yet target specific medicines for a short duration. This includes use of Panchagavya ghrita, Mahatiktaka ghrita etc for snehana during panchakarma; Hridroga chintamani rasa, Prabhakar vati, Drakshasava etc. Recurrence is avoided by following a balanced diet, prescribed water intake, proper sleep-wake cycle and staying away from addictions. Practising Achara rasayana is essential. It refers to the rejuvenation of mind by following principles such as truthfulness, non-violence, compassion, maintaining hygiene, being humble and noble etc.<br><br>In brief, simple yet fulfilling lifestyle changes coupled with medications (until necessary) will guarantee a healthy heart, mind and normal blood pressure!</p>

(AV block or heart block)<br><br>Tachycardia<br><br>Addition of abnormal impulses to the normal cardiac cycle causes tachycardia. Abnormal impulses can begin by one of three mechanisms: automaticity, re-entry or triggered activity. Fibrillation is a specialised form of re-entry mechanism.<br><br>Automaticity : The cardiac muscle cell fires off an impulse automatically without waiting for the SA (Sino-Atrial) node. It (cell/origin) is called an ectopic focus. If it fires more often than SA node, it produces a continuous abnormal rhythm.<br><br>Re-entry : Occurs when an electrical impulse recurrently travels in a tight circle within the heart, instead of moving from one end to the other and then stopping. These types of are different from conditions which utilize abnormal conduction pathways.<br><br>Fibrillation : Multiple micro re-entry circuits cause the heart to beat rapidly with irregular &amp; unsynchronised contraction of cardiac muscle cells. It can affect the atrium (atrial fibrillation) or the ventricle (ventricular fibrillation / V-fib). V-fib is life-threatening. It is considered a form of cardiac arrest.<br><br>Investigations : Blood tests, Chest X-Ray, ECG &amp; Holter monitor, ECHO, Transesophageal atrial stimulation etc.<br><br>Treatment : Physical manoeuvres – vagal manoeuvres, Medications – anti arrhythmic drugs, anti coagulant &amp; anti-platelet drugs like warfarin &amp; heparins, aspirin, cardioversion, defibrillation; ICD, pacemakers, Electro or cryo – cautery etc.<br><br>Ayurveda perspective of Arrhythmia<br><br>Disrupted rhythm in the heart is an issue concentrated in the organ itself, or so it seems. Ayurveda looks at any change in physiology at all levels – physical and mental. Problems of (or arising in) hridaya initially develop as smaller issues (unrelated to heart itself) such as untreated chronic gastric irritation, bloating, constipation etc. Other possibility is the samprapti involving hridaya directly. The former is more commonly seen clinically than the latter.<br><br>Focusing on the latter, initially vata kopa (along with both or one of kapha, pitta) at rasa dhatu level causes commonly elicited Rasa vikriti. Based on extent of dosha imbalance, signs and symptoms such as Hriddrava (palpitations), shwasavarodha / krichra shwasa (breathlessness / laboured breathing), hricchoola (pain in the chest region), bhrama (light headedness / dizziness), glani (easy exhaustion), atanka (unexplained anxiety / agitation to small problems) begin. If this is left untreated (or only symptomatically addressed), the circulating dushta rasa dhatu carry dosha through Hridaya and other srotas causing exacerbation of existing issues in addition to others such as blackouts, coldness of extremities, sleep disturbances, intolerance, increased incidences of pain in / around chest etc. If the samprapti vighatana does not occur at this stage too, sthana samshraya of dushta dosha can occur in Hridaya. Mainly vata kopa can enhance due to sanga/avarodha which in turn leads to re-entry type mechanism. With time, this vata becomes dhatugata or leena. This causes improper gati and further causes sthanika dhatu kshaya. Fibrillation may be explained with this. Sudden expulsion of vyana coupled with prana leads to death. De-fibrillation causes vyana to forcefully move against sanga/avarodha eliciting extreme pain in already weakened hridaya. Opposed to this, vata gati can also get slowed down by either vata kshaya or avarodha, causing Bradycardia. This can occur in case dushta kapha is present. Vimarga gamana coupled with kupita vata may lead to Tachycardia, which requires coupling of pitta and vata.<br><br>Other samprapti of Anyonyavarana (vyana-prana; prana-udana; vyana-udana etc), Avarodhajanya vata kopa can also be considered to explain disrupted rhythm. Vata remains the prima factor as it controls all movements. However, for a more focused approach, pitta is considered essential. To slow down or obstruct the same, kapha remains fundamental. Role of Sadhaka pitta in generation of impulses, vyana vata in conduction and avalambaka kapha in sustenance needs further study.<br><br>The hridaya can fall victim to any vata pradhana vyadhi. Therefore, marma palana is emphasised while treating the same. In the current scenario, lifestyle disorders act as harbingers of cardiac complications. Therefore avoiding nidana such as stress, exposure to sudden scares and anxious situations (trasa); use of ushna and teekshna (spicy, sharp and penetrating tastes), rooksha (dry) food, activities which cause excess increase / decrease / vitiation of dosha such as exposure to extreme temperatures, winds and such; remains cornerstone of treatment. Practises of abhyanga regularly, seasonal shodhana, addressing minor ailments effectively (at root levels, not just symptomatic alleviation) and focusing on long term protection of hridaya using medicines such as Brihat vata chintamani rasa, Abhraka bhasma, Swarna kalpas etc will keep the heart healthy, and the person wealthy and wise.</p>

It may afflict body or mind or both. It can occur with varying signs and symptoms ranging from simple ones such as increased trishna (thirst) to pralapa (delirium). Jwara is treated as an all encompassing disease in Ayurveda and therefore, the term “jwara” refers to both a disease in itself as well as any other disease entity which affects the body.<br><br>Hridi vyatha or pain in the heart / chest region is described as jwara prabhava by Acharya Charaka. In avisargi jwara or a condition when jwara has not completely set in, hridayasya avishuddi is pointed out. This generally refers to a feeling of fullness / tightness in the chest region along with unexplainable discomfort in the heart/chest. It also means a lack of clarity of thought. Another direct reference in Charaka Samhitha regarding the involvement of heart in jwara would be the occurrence of Hridroga in case of forceful / improper emesis in taruna jwara.<br><br>The signs and symptoms of myocarditis and endocarditis to an extent overlap with the lakshana of ama jwara. And those of pericarditis are found to resemble pachyamana jwara lakshana. Inflammation is never without the involvement of pitta dosha, vata dosha, rasa dhatu and rakta dhatu. Chronic or recurrent fever like symptoms (Jeerna or sannipataja jwara) causes Pitta vitiation along with Vata. In line with the involvement of dhatu, rasa-rakta-mamsa-meda and jwara of these levels (rasa dhatugata jwara, rakta dhatugata jwara etc) may be thought of. If not treated timely, the condition can worsen as dosha afflict majja dhatu and beyond.<br><br>Apart from jwara, the signs and symptoms also overlap with conditions such as pittaja gulma, pittaja grahani, sannipathaja jwara, hridi vidradhi etc. even though the inflammatory disorders are not found under a single heading (apart from Jwara rogadhikara), a broader perspective on the disease can be found across the Samhithas. Therefore the chikitsa krama will also be a comprehensive approach in Ayurveda.</p>

In general, heart fails due to any condition which causes damage or overloading and in turn, decreases the efficiency of the heart muscle. It may also be due to less input to the heart itself in the first place, or due to peripheral resistance (diseases of artery). This functional failure may be attributed directly to adverse effects of Vata vikruti, especially that of Vyana (which is the one which circulates all over). The other 4 also vata share equal responsibility in bringing about a disturbance in filling /output. For example, in case of samana vikruti (commonly seen in case of gastritis – bloating, flatulence, belching etc), palpitations are often experienced. If this is not treated, it may affect udana vata, and may end up in hridaya-related complications.<br><br>The symptoms seen such as shrama (fatigue), agni mandya / vaishamya (altered appetite), weight gain, kasa (cough), hriddrava (palpitations), udara (fluid accumulation in abdomen, similar to Ascites), shwasawarodha (breathlessness/laboured breathing),&nbsp;pada shotha (pedal edema) etc are seen in diseases like Pandu, udara, shotha, udavarta, shwasa, hridroga etc. Chronic or recurrent cough, respiratory infections leads to Vata moving in different directions rather than the path of action. This increases pressure on heart and surrounding structures, which may lead to cardiomegaly due to constant overworking (vata vriddhi). This in turn leads to dhatu shaithilya, causing structural damage. Similar is the pathogenesis of Udavarta, where Apana may be the culprit due to improper lifestyle habits. In Pandu roga, involvement of heart can be understood based on the vikruta Rasa dhatu (vitiated / improperly formed /unformed rasa) involved.<br><br>Other causes include arsha, bhagandara, asrgdhara, abhighata etc conditions where dhatu kshaya (predominantly rasa and rakta) is apparent. This may be seen in light of hampered input of blood to heart. The initial samprapti points at rasa dhatu reduction (quantity and / or quality). Symptoms are often seen to begin with those of rasa vikriti such as klama (fatigue without exertion) and shabdha asahishnuta (irritation / anxiety to moderate sounds or noises). Many cases may also present with kapha pradhana samprapti where kleda management required utmost care and attention. Due to involvement of vata (especially samana), pittanubandha nadee is also elicited.<br><br>The treatment protocol follows the order of identifying and stopping the causative factors, treating potential underlying conditions such as pandu, arsha, shwasa etc; while establishing a healthy regimen for marma paripalana. Generally, deepana and pachana are preferred to bring about rasa dhatu samyata. Next, condition specific approaches (including panchakarma) are listed. Medicines such as Mukkadi vati, Amrutottara kashaya, Shiva gulika, Punarnava Mandura, Amavatari rasa, Lakshmi vilasa rasa, Ashta churna etc are used. Lifestyle correction remains the foundational element. Remember, if you fail to take care of yourself, your heart will fail you!</p>

                                    <p class="mb-0">A condition in which the heart valves have been permanently damaged by rheumatic fever.<br><br>Cause : It is caused by a bacterium belonging to Streptococcus. Infection can lead to strep throat or in some, scarlet fever.<br><br>Signs &amp; symptoms :<br><br>Fever<br>Swollen, tender, red and extremely painful joints — particularly knees &amp; ankles<br>Nodules (lumps under the skin)<br>Red, raised, lattice-like rash, usually on the chest, back, and abdomen<br>Shortness of breath and chest discomfort<br>Uncontrolled movements of arms, legs, or facial muscles<br>Weakness<br>Shortness of breath (especially with activity or when lying down)<br>Chest pain<br>Swelling<br>Mechanism : It is an inflammatory disease that can affect many connective tissues, especially in the heart, joints, or brain. The heart valves get inflamed and become scarred over time. This results in narrowing or leaking of the valve making it difficult for the proper functioning of heart. This can take many years to develop and can result in heart failure.<br><br>Investigations : Blood tests – for inflammation/ infection, ECHO, Chest X-Ray, Cardiac MRI<br><br>Treatment : Antibiotics, NSAIDs, Steroids; for heart failure: ACE inhibitors, diuretics, beta blockers, and digoxin etc.<br><br>Ayurveda perspective<br><br>Like any other inflammatory disease, rheumatic fever, falls under the category of jwara rogadhikara in Ayurveda. As described under the Ayurveda perspective of inflammatory diseases of heart, jwara roga has a all encompassing outreach. Acharyas have specifically described lakshana such as pandu, dinata (uneasiness), glaani (fatigue), shwayathu (edema), kushta with patches (skin lesions), kandu (itching) etc in Punaravartita jwara. These are also described in Rheumatic fever. Jeerna jwara and Sannipataja jwara lakshana can also be recounted here.<br><br>Therefore, rheumatic fever also falls under the purview of jwara roga, with extensions found in diseases which involve affliction of pitta and vata dosha at the levels of rasa, rakta and mamsa dhatu. If and when jwara is untreated / inadequately managed or if the person indulges in food/ activities which are apathya, the doshas tend to increase + affect the deeper dhatus. This also ensures that this dosha vaishamya becomes chronic, resulting in manifestation of diseases of hridaya. The residual effect is explained as jwara udarka. It is therefore necessary not only to treat simple fever but to educate about pathya, apathya and period of recovery.<br><br>Please Note :&nbsp;<br>Ayurvedic diagnosis involves the understanding of Dosha, Dhatu and Mala of an individual, through the means of different Pareeksha (Examination and investigations like Nadi reading etc). Therefore cardiovascular diseases may not always fall under Hrudroga. They may develop as consequences of underlying anomalies such as Udavarta (caused by improper movement of Vata resulting in reduced appetite, constipation etc), Pandu (anemia), Arsha (pile mass), chronic gastritis etc. Hence the treatment will be to curb the causative pathology while subsequently maintaining the cardiac health.&nbsp;<br><br>For comparison and interpretation, refer to articles under Heart care, Prevention and Management.</p>

Bone cancers are primary only that starts from bone itself is called Sarcomas. Sarcomas starts in bone, muscle, fibrous tissues, blood vessels, fat tissue and some other tissues.<br><br>Cancer and Sarcoma:<br><br>Carcinomas are cancers that develop in epithelial cells, which cover the internal organs and outer surfaces of your body.<br><br>Sarcomas are cancers that develop in mesenchymal cells, which make up both your bones and soft tissues, such as muscles, tendons, and blood vessels.<br><br>Primary Bone sarcoma constitute as the 3rd most common cause of mortality in adolescents and most commonly affects the long bones. 5years over all survival rate is 65-70% in adolescent’s age group, if metastasis to other parts will reduce survival rate.&nbsp;Benign tumours of bone are not life threating as they often cured with surgery.<br><br>Types of primary bone cancers are:<br><br>Osteosarcoma: Osteogenic sarcoma is most common type which stats from bone cells. Effects age group between 10-30 years and 10% in 60 to 70 years. It is more common in males and most commonly seen in long bones.<br><br>Chondrosacroma: It is 2nd most common and it starts in cartilage cells (some time from trachea, larynx, scapula, ribs and skull). Rare in &lt; 20 years age and risk group is 20-75 years. Most common in females. It can start in cartilage tissue but commonly seen in hip, leg and arm bones. Benign tumour are common in cartilage origin.<br><br>Ewing Tumor: 3rd common and 2nd most common in children, teens and young adults. Most common site it pelvis, chest wall and long bones.<br><br>Malignant fibrous histiocytoma: Most often starts in soft tissue like ligament, tendon, fat and muscle and rare in bones. Commonly seen in elderly and middle age in legs or arms. Most of time it is localized but some time metastatic in nature to lungs.<br><br> Fibrosarcoma: More likely occur in soft tissue effecting middle age and elderly, Long bones and jaw are most often affected.<br><br>Giant cell bone tumor: It is of both benign and malignant types, Benign affects knee or arms of young and middle aged adults. They recur in the same place after operation.<br><br>Chordoma: Usually occur in base of skull and spine.<br><br>Risk factors:<br><br>Unknown<br><br>Very less number are linked to hereditary factors<br><br>Exposure to larger doses of radiation<br><br>Signs and Symptoms:<br><br>Swelling and tenderness near affected area<br><br>Bone pain<br><br>Week bone and pathological fracture<br><br>Weight loss<br><br>Diagnosis:<br><br>Biopsy either by core needle or open<br><br>Radiological investigations simple x- ray to PET CT<br><br>Bone scan<br><br>Treatment:<br><br>Surgery if localized<br><br>Chemotherapy<br><br>Radiation therapy<br><br>Targeted therapy<br><br>Immunotherapy<br><br>Ayurveda approach:<br><br>As disease involving or originates in deeper Dhatu (tissues) like Meda( ~adipose), Asthi (~Bone) , Majja (~Bone marrow) and Surka ( ~reproductive fluids) are maintenance as difficult to treat.<br><br>If patient Bala (Strength) is good then we can go for Panchakaram, Vanama or virechan or both depending on need.<br><br>Basti ( ~medicated enema).<br><br>Will be choice of therapy as it is applicable from birth to elderly.<br><br>Vata and Asthi (~bone) are indirectly proportional i.e., if Vata increase will reduce the Asthi.<br><br>It is the best treatment to treat Vata and use of tikata rasa ksheerabasti directly nourishing the bone and found effective most of done degenerative diseases.<br><br>Herbal and herb mineral combination to strengthen Majjadhatu ( ~bone marrow) so that bone change are should not influence Majja if happen so the bone cancer or denegation will get accelerated.<br><br>Most of bone cancer are supportive and palliative treatments but treatment stated in very initial stages will be highly beneficial.<br><br>References:<br><br>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4991135/<br>https://www.cancer.org<br>https://www.cancer.net</p>

                                    <p class="mb-0">Anxiety is a feel of worry or apprehensiveness about certain situation or the outcome of the situation. Everyone feels anxious at some point of their life. The feeling of anxiety can be high during stressful moments like exams, starting a new job, making life- changing decision, or loss of a loved one. Anxiety is mostly triggered by external situations and a person’s reaction to the situation. It is normal for everyone to feel anxious. But, for some people, anxiety is constant, which keeps them from enjoying their daily life and even having a normal relationship with people around.<br><br><br><br>Did you know that there is an anxiety treatment in Ayurveda?

It has the same qualities of the Fall season; dry, light, rough, mobile.<br><br><br><br>Anxiety is an expression of excess vata in Mano vaha srota, the channel of mind.<br><br><br><br>To put it plainly, it means you have a windy mind.<br><br><br><br>When it comes to bringing back to balance a dosha that is in excess, we follow the Ayurvedic principle of “like increases like, and the opposite balances.”<br><br><br><br>Anxiety treatment in Ayurveda first involves identifying the type of anxiety disorder and its cause.anxiety treatment in Ayurveda, no matter what type it is, involves ensuring the patient gets better sleep, strict diet and proper regimen. These basic practices go a long way in reducing panic attack.<br><br><br><br>Herbs such as ashwagandha, brahmi, mandukaparni, yastimadhu, jatamamsi, amla, vacha etc have been found effective in reducing the symptoms of anxiety and relaxing the body and mind.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-0">Autism spectrum is a developmental disorder caused due to differences in the brain, which can be caused due to genetic conditions. It affects how a person perceives and socializes with others and causes problems in social interaction and communication. This starts manifesting in childhood that causes problems to work, school and home.<br><br><br><br>Symptoms of Autism spectrum<br><br><br><br>The person is unable to communicate<br><br>Delayed speech<br><br>Loses previous ability to say words<br><br>Speaks in abnormal tone<br><br>Unable to express emotions<br><br>Can’t start a conversation<br><br>Self-harming activities<br><br>Sensitive to light and touch<br><br>Fixates on an object etc.<br><br>Understanding Autism with Ayurveda<br><br><br><br>According to Ayurveda, autism spectrum disorder is a behavioral abnormality that is manifested due to defects in neuropsychological platform and derangement of metabolism and digestive system. ‘Unmada’ is the term that can be related to autism in Ayurveda. The impairments in this condition include – Manasa, Buddhi, Samjna janana, Bhakthi, Sheela, Chesta and achara. It can be summarized as, a person’s jnanotpathy (the acquisition of knowledge that happens only when Manas is in sync with Atma, Indriya and Indriyartha) is disturbed.<br><br><br><br>Thus, in order to treat autism spectrum in Ayurveda, it is important to note a persons’ physical, mental and emotional state. This is done by various therapies like Daiva Vyapasraya, Yukti Vyapasraya and Satvajaya Vyapasraya. It is also accompanied by panchakarma procedures that help in cleaning toxins from the channels and restoring the connection between body, mind and soul. This line of treatment helps in reversal from symptoms of autism and encourages a person’s social behaviour.<br><br><br><br>Types :<br><br><br><br>Austic disorder: This is referred to as “classic” autism. When most people suffer major language deficits, social and communication difficulties, as well as odd habits and interests. Many people who have autism also have intellectual disabilities.<br><br>Asperger syndrome: Austic symptoms are frequently milder in those with Asperger syndrome. They may exhibit social difficulties as well as unique actions and interests. They do not, however, often have linguistic or intellectual disabilities.<br><br>Pervasive development disorder: This is sometimes known as PDD-NOS or “atypical autism”. Atypical autism refers to those who satisfy some but not all of the criteria for autistic disorder or Asperger syndrome. These folks often have fewer and milder syndrome than people who have autism. The symptoms may just create social and communication difficulties.<br><br>Ayurveda Perspective of Autism<br><br><br><br>The beauty of Ayurveda lies in its strong view of Jivita (life) as sustaining combination of sareera (physical body), satva (mind) and atma(spirit).<br><br><br><br>Ayurveda has viewed ASD as a behavioral abnormality with its roots embedded in the defective neuropsychological platform and derangement in digestive and metabolic system.<br><br><br><br>Autism, typical or atypical and other disorders with autistic features fall under the category of Unmada, in which one or more of the mental faculties go wrong. The very definition of unmada incorporates various forms of inappropriate actions exhibited by the individual as a result of distortion of normal mind, intellect, conscious knowledge, memory, desire, manner and behaviour.<br><br><br><br>In the definition of unmada, we find some of the impaired faculties which are seen in Autism spectrum Disorders. These includes impairment of<br><br><br><br>Manas – mind – total or partial loss of sensory perception<br><br>Buddhi – intellect – partially affected – could be abnormal as seen in savant abilities.<br><br>Samjna Jnana – conscious presence – seen as being lost in their own world, barring one or more sensory stimuli<br><br>Bhakti – desire – innate willing to communicate with others<br><br>Seela – manners – inappropriate emotional outbursts and adhering to specific rigid routines<br><br>Cheshta – activities – motor stereotypes which are inappropriate and compulsive<br><br>Achara – learnt skills – impaired socialization skills, inability to follow commands, losing of good habits etc.<br><br>The acquisition of knowledge (jnotpathy), one among the important functions of Manas is distributed in Unmada. Jnanotpathy happens only when Manas is in tune with Atma (soul), Indriya (sense organ), Indriyartha (objects).<br><br><br><br>The concept of genetic defects (Beeja dusthti), antenatal psychological stress, non-congenial dietetics (Virudha ahara) disturbing the metabolism (gut brain axis), defective parental psychological back ground (parental genetic makeup) and faulty child rearing system (refrigerated parentage, neglected childhood, monitor addiction) have the key role in the etiopathology of Unmada and ASD.<br><br><br><br>Ayurveda believes that in addition to the food and activities of the pregnant mother, her mental status plays an important role for the development of health and disease – both physical and mental in the child.<br><br><br><br>Ayurveda Management of Autism<br><br><br><br>There are three classical therapeutic streams advocated by Ayurveda which used in the management of Autism Spectrum Disorders (Unmada). They are<br><br><br><br>Daiva Vyapasraya (Confidence building treatment) – rites and rituals to ward off the unseen evil forces (environmental agents including microorganisms) and in turn protecting the body and mind.<br><br>Yukthi Vyapasraya (Rational Medical Management) – rational prescription of drugs, therapies, food and activities to keep the equilibrium of the body intact.<br><br>Satvavajaya (Mind or self-control techniques) – cognitive, behavioural and spiritual knowledge and training methods to develop and maintain the mental faculties.<br><br>The rational Ayurveda treatment is carried out in four parts. Thay are<br><br><br><br>Dosha pacifying therapy (Samsamana)<br><br>Bio-cleansing therapy (Samshodhana or Panchakarma)<br><br>Avoidance of causative factors (Nidana Parivarjana)<br><br>Favourable diet and regimens (Pathya Aharavihara)</p>
